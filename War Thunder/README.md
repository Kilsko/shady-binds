Automatic gear tank throttle is a little wonky in WT. I have it assigned in two ways to the X-55 throttle to help make up for that. The complicated way is mentioned first, and is the default setup. The tank throttle is assigned to the x-55 dual throttle control with the 0-49% covering reverse gear, 50% covering a shady neutral, and 50-100% positive acceleration with the game choosing the correct gear for you. In this mode you'll need to make use of the left and right brakes for proper control(rudder pedal breaks work nicely if available). The left brake is the left button on the back of the throttle referred to as H by Saitek, the right break is the button named I to the right of the last one, and both breaks together at the same time is clicking of the rotary 2 G push button next to the thumb sticks. 

If this mode is too much of a hassle, you can just use the H3 thumb stick next to the dual breaks for forward-back-left-right control without needing to rely on breaks for control. Simply unassign in WT the tank throttle axis from the X-55 throttle.

TrackIR profile is pulled from http://dslyecxi.com/trackir5/. The default recenter key may need to be reassigned to something more easily reachable. I make use of the silver scroll FWD and BCK wheels on the left of the throttle for TrackIR.
