#Words:
The Saitek programming profile (Saitek X-55 DCS UH-1H.pr0) relies on the default keyboard mappings in DCS UH-1H. The only mappings that need to be done within DCS are those related to axis ranges and appear all together under one page on the controls screen. There are screenshots included to provide an example of how the axis controls should be assigned, but keep in mind I use rudder pedals so adjust to taste. There's also two TrackIR assignments in the Saitek pr0 file under MODE1 and MODE2 for the throttle G rotary click that can be swapped based on your arrangement. 

#What follows is a low fat list of buttons to massage on the X55 to complete the UH-1H cold start tutorial.
t: throttle		s: stick

##PreGame:
- Set MODE1 on throttle.
- Rotate tF rotary CCW to end.
- Rotate tG rotary to center.
- Rotate tRTY3 CCW to end.
- Rotate tRTY4 CCW to end.

##IntroScreen:
- sB to Fly.

##First Dialogue:
- sC for |SPACE BAR| continue.

##Buttoning Up:
- tSLD (return to default left position) to close cockpit door.

##Gimmie Power (Look with your eyes to the overhead midline panel):
- tTGL4 down for AC voltmeter.
- tTGL3 down for DC generator.
- tTGL2 down twice for DC voltmeter.
- tTGL1 down for battery.

##Loud Noises: (Look bottom midline panel):
- tSW2 to turn off audible RPM warning.
- tH4 down to test indicator light panel.
- tSW4 to turn on fuel flow.
- tSW1 for force trim.
- tSW3 for hydraulic control.

##*BUG only in tutorial*
- The throttle will not unlock using default X55 throttle rotary. You have to either use the keyboard to hit Page Down->Page Up->Page Down or accomplish the same using the mouse click and vertical drag on the throttle grip attached to the collective.

##Invisible Things (Listen to the instructions!):
- tF rotary click to start the engine.

##Finally! (Look overhead midline):
- tTGL4 up to turn inverter on.[]
##I Lied, There's Still the Radios (Bottom midline panel):  =D

*Also, another BUG/Feature.* 
- There is currently no way to assign a key to toggle the transponder since it's just for appearances. Regardless, the cold start tutorial makes you turn it on, and the only way to do that is by right clicking on the highlighted knob.

- Set tMODE3.
- tTGL4 down for VHF NAV COMM.
- tTGL2 down for VHF COMM.
- tH for UHF radio.
- tRTY3 to the required interphone position.
- tK down for VHF FM.
- tH4 down for ADF radio.

##Almost Done FoRealz: 
- Set tMODE1
- tTGL2 up for starter generator. (Overhead midline panel)
- tF rotary CW slowly to max to open throttle. (Collective twist grip)
- tH4 up to turn off master caution light.
