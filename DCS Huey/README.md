The Saitek programming profile (Saitek X-55 DCS UH-1H.pr0) relies on the default keyboard mappings in DCS UH-1H. The few controller mapping changes in DCS that cannot be done effectively in the Saitek profiler are also here (DCS UH-1H Sim *).

If you don't have TrackIR, you can set the X-55 throttle F push (top rotary click) to something other than TrackIR Center in the Saitek programming tab.
