TrackIR profiles go in the TrackIR program directory folder named Profiles. Ex: "C:\Program Files (x86)\NaturalPoint\TrackIR5\Profiles"

Double check that within TrackIR, center is RShift+F12 and pause is RShift+F9. I keep my Speed at 1 and Smooth at 20. And the Exclusive box is checked for my selected profile.


Saitek X-55 profiles go into the Mad Catz folder found under the Public Documents folder. Ex: "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Mad Catz\X-55 Rhino"

In the Saitek profiler I have all of the throttle axis set to Deadband 0, Curvature 500, X-Sat 1000, and Y-Sat 1000 or just click the linear S curve profile in the bottom right. For the stick, X and Y axis is Deadband 60, Curvature 600, X-Sat 1000, Y-Sat 1000. These settings also work for the Rudder axis although I have mine off for rudder pedals. You may need to increase or decrease the Rudder deadband to compensate for any center "stickiness" observed on the profiler when moving slowly across the axis. Use the Calibrate Axes function in the profiler periodically.

In DCS you will have to clear the default X-55 assignments. Do this by going into the controls setup screen, selecting the MiG-15bis Sim Layer and the Axis Commands category. Now look for the columns for the Saitek stick and throttle. You may have to use the bottom scroll bar as well as hovering your mouse pointer over the column name to identify which is which. Click an element from one of the columns and then hit the Clear category button at the top. Assign your axis mappings and then do the same for the other column. You will also have to do this for your rudder pedals if you have any. Do not change the default keyboard mappings for any of the other control categories as the Saitek profiler depends on these default assignments for anything not assigned by you in the DCS Axis Commands category. The default TrackIR assignments inside DCS should also be left as-is. You should finally double check that there are no Saitek or rudder assignments to any of the functions listed under the All category.
